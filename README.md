# Huffman Compression

Please note: The properly compressed binary files are
larger than expected, since writing the number of bits
as a header in the binary file drastically increases the compressed
file's size.

Program Usage:

- Any incorrect usage of the program will give the user feedback
  on what went wrong during execution.
- The program is run using the following command-line arguments:
  `./huffencode <input_file> <output_file></code>`

The path to the folder that contains the input text file has to be specified.The program will automatically add extensions to your file names.

- Example input: `<code>./huffencode test_files/test5 test5_output </code>`
